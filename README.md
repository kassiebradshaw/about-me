# LAB - 02

## About Me

* I created a short "about me" quiz that asks the user 5 questions about me and lets them know if they are correct. Then my page gives a bit of my background.

* I added a number guessing game where the user has 4 chances to guess my birthday.

* I added a feature for the user to try and guess one of my favorite movies. There were 3 possible correct answers, and the user had 6 chances to guess it right.

* I added a feature to keep score of the user's correct answers and notify them at the end how many they got right.

* I added a Top 10 Favorite Movies ordered list to my HTML page
